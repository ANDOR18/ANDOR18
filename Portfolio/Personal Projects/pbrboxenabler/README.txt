Purpose:

This simple tool is designed to unlock box functionality in Pokemon Battle Revolution (PBR) for those who
are unable to connect a DS (ideally those who are playing on Dolphin) but wish to inject and use Pokemon via a program such as PKHeX.

Files needed:

-PbrSaveData

-pbrsavetool.exe (https://projectpokemon.org/forums/applications/core/interface/file/attachment.php?id=30347)

-pbrboxenabler.exe

-------------

Instructions:

1. Place 'pbrsavetool.exe' and 'pbrboxenabler.exe' in the same folder as your PBR save (should be named 'PbrSaveData').

2. Run 'pbrsavetool.exe' and enter the 'd' key to decrypt your PBR save. 
	- You should get two files:
		- 'PbrSaveData_decrypted_current'
		- 'PbrSaveData_decrypted_backup'

3. Run 'pbrboxenabler.exe' and enter the save number you wish to enable box functions for.
	-The file to be modified MUST be named 'PbrSaveData_decrypted_current'. The program will give an error otherwise.

4. Run 'pbrsavetool.exe' once more and enter the 'e' key to re-encrypt your save

5. Success! The option to check your boxes should now be available.
